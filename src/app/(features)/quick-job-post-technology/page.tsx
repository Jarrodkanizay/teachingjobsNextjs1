            academic vacancy on a job board. The cumbersome process of
            categorizing, and promoting job listings on various platforms such
            as Seek, Indeed, and <span className="uni-jobs">Uni</span>Jobs has
            been dramatically simplified by TeachingJobs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Higher Ed Quick Job Post Technology addresses these inefficiencies
