            work and study, the benefits are enormous, especially if you have
            on-the-job experience to draw from that can enrich your studies, and
            vice versa. You'll also still be earning a salary, therefore

            for each study session in order to meet the requirements for your

            after graduation, it's more difficult. Remember, as an international
            student, you should never expect to live on the money you make while

            financial needs.

            way for international students to supplement their income.
            International students working full-time in retail and hospitality
            can earn between AUD 600 to AUD 1,000 per week.
